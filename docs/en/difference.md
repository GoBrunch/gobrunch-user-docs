# Difference between Quick Meetings and Events

When using **Quick Meetings**, the microphone and camera of all participants automatically turn on. You have no control over their mic and cameras. Here the focus is basically *video-conferences*, *video-calls* and *online meetings*. 

By creating **Events**, you will be in charge of who speaks and who will appear on the screen. Here the focus is *webinars* and *training*.
