## General Signing Up to Explore GoBrunch

With **Gobrunch**, *live webinars* and *virtual meetings* have never been easier to use for learning and also interacting with others while at it. The website is beautiful designed, easy, intuitive and **free** for all users. Let’s quickly take a tour.

Here is a step by step dummies guide on how to sign up for *Gobrunch*.

Upon clicking, it shows *Live Tutorial*, *About*, *Contact*, *Blog*, *Sign In* and *Sign Up* links. It is an easy way to navigate to any of these pages when surfing through *GoBrunch*.
