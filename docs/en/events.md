## Creating Your Event

*Events* are more detailed and contain more features than the regular *Quick Meeting*. With *Events*, you get to add a location, set when the time and date the event starts and ends. You can also add another presenter apart from yourself to be showed with you in the *session’s description*.

To create an event, click on the **Create your Event or Classroom** button from the *Lobby*.

Enter the name of the event, it’s description and the location you’d like the event to hold.

Select the session name and describe what the session is all about (you can copy and paste from your event’s description).

Select the language you want your event to be (from the language drop-down).

You can set your *session* to either be *public* or *private*. *Public* means we will list your webinar in our Lobby, so anyone would have access to register in it. If you are creating an *event* for **testing** purposes, make sure to switch to *private*, otherwise people might register, receive reminders and come online to attend.

Next, you set the time you want your session to start. Please **Note** that *sessions* must not be in the past, i.e. it should precede the date of event creation.

Select your seating arrangement and how many people you want to attend your event. Our biggest auditorium fits **409 attendees**. Keep in mind that only 15% to 35% from people who register usually attend a webinar, specially if you don’t know them. If it’s a corporate internal training, then the rate might be higher.

You can also add another presenter if you want. **Note** that additional presenters don’t have priviledges to control the session. The only benefit is to display their name and pics on the event’s description. Also **Note** that you can only add a presenter if he/she is already your friend. Check [how to add a friend](friends.md).

Another exclusive feature GoBrunch offers is the ability to create additional *Sessions* (the last sliding circles). Each one creates a new *door* and a new *room* in the *Lounge*. This is very useful especially if you want to provide **break-out-sessions** to your event.

Click on **Create Event** when you’re done. You’ll get an email confirming your event has been successfully created with the Landing Page link, which you can use to share with yout community.

You’ll be redirected to the **Lounge** of the location you selected. Click on the *arrow* to enter into the main room.

## Editing your Event

Navigate to the *Lobby*, scroll down, you would see a list of your created events. Click **Edit** on the Event you want to modify.

From the *My Events*, you can see the number of registrants per *Event*. If you click on it, it downloads a spreadsheet containing the details of the attendants.
