# Promoting your Meetings and Webinars

Here are some strategies you can apply to promote your *Webinar*:

- Create your own **email marketing campaigns** and share the event’s link.

- Share the Event’s link on your ***LinkedIn***, ***Facebook*** and ***Twitter***.

- Share the Event’s link by ***text*** with your friends.

- Invite people through GoBrunch’s ***Invite your Friends by e-mail*** box. You can find it either on the *Lobby* Page or People icon located on the side menu bar. Multiple addresses should be separated by a comma. **Note** that we don’t send two e-mails to the same person on the same event to avoid spam.

- **Invite *Who’s Online***: You can invite users by clicking on the people icon:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7pl0C2Y.png" title="source: imgur.com" /><br>Click on the dialog icon as shown in the picture below:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NcMjR1f.png" title="source: imgur.com" /><br>If the user is online and you invite him, he will receive a notification, if he accepts, he will land in your room where you can start a conversation. If he is your friend and he is offline, he will receive an email.

- Ultimately, if you set your event as *public*, the users will always be able to see your event in our Lobby. So, everyone who browses our webinar’s catalog will be able to find and register to your event..
